## What we will Cover today

- Recap:
    - Setting up our ***environment***
    - Creating an `RProject`
    - Initializing and Creating a Shiny App
- Quick tips for EDA (explorator data analysis)
- How to enhance our Shiny app

# RECAP
## What is an environment? 
An environment includes:

- software version
- libraries
- datasets
- variables and functions
- scripts & other files (files that end in `.R` or `.Rmd`)

... essentially everything that is contained within---you guessed it!---the `.Rproj` 

## Why should I control my environment?
 - easy to set-up again
 - you'll get better understanding errors that arrise
     - and you'll know it's not your environment's fault because it's been controlled
     - if it is your environment's fault troubleshooting can take as long as it took to write the entire anlysis
     
## R Project files:
Used to control your environment.
The extention is `Rproj`

## New Project:
`File >> New Project >>Save Current Workspace >> New Project >>Create Directory

1. Create Directory
    - Creates a new folder to place new files
2. Choose Existing
    - Takes the contents of an existing folder and adds those to a new _project_ _environment_.

## New Project:
`File >> New Project >>Save Current Workspace >> New Project >>Create Directory

`Notice:` if you have files that are open when creating a new R Project, R will ask you if you want to save without telling you that it's going to close everything after! Choose to save, you'll thank R later.

## Open Project
What if you have a _'project'_ but it's not an Rproj file? 
`File >> New Project >> Existing Directory`

Otherwise `File >> Open Project`

## Download the data
You don't have to download the data directly to computer and then move the csv into your working directory and then read it... go straight to the data.
If you have a url link to download it, then you can skip the process...

1. Find URL
2. Trim the URL name to from `'http ___> .csv'` or `.txt`  

```{r}
utah <- read.csv(file = 
  'https://opendata.utah.gov/api/views/88ws-42u9/rows.csv',
  header=TRUE, sep=',', na.strings = "*")
```


## EDA: Quick Look
There are a couple ways to quickly look at the data.
```{r eval=FALSE}
utah[1:10, ]
```
This is great because I can see more or less than 5 rows. And I can control the `[row, column]` slice. So I could take some middle rows or the last rows.

```{r eval=TRUE}
utah[1:10, ]
```


## EDA: Quick Look
There are a couple ways to quickly look at the data.
```{r eval = FALSE}
head(utah, n=3)
```
Quick and the standard. And I can still see  `head(utah, n=8)`
This is great because I can see more or less than 5 rows. I can also use `tail(utah)` and get the last 5 observations, too.

## EDA: Quick Look
There are a couple ways to quickly look at the data.
```{r}
head(utah, n=3)
```


## EDA: Quick Look
My preferred method.
```{r ,eval= FALSE}
str(utah)
```
Why?  Because going against the grain is great! No, it's merely because I get 1 column per line, and the number of examples that trail when reading to the right are enought to give you an idea of what's there... but that's not all. `str()` also tells you the type of data that is included in that column.  It gives you a cheat sheet as to how you're going to set up your __data preprocessing__. 

## EDA: Quick Look
My preferred method.
```{r ,eval= TRUE}
str(utah)
```


## EDA: Data Preprocessing
### Converting a Column to another data type

```{r echo = TRUE}
typeof(utah$Mean.Annual.Wage[1])
```
### `"integer"` means numeric, but...
if this column is stored in the dataframe as a factor then it will not be usable as is. We will need to alter the column to a numeric storage type.

## EDA: Data Preprocessing
### Converting a Column to another data type

```{r echo=TRUE}
utah$Mean.Annual.Wage = as.numeric(as.character(utah$Mean.Annual.Wage))
typeof(utah$Mean.Annual.Wage[1])
## Now that it's numeric you can add and do other operations
```
### `"double"` means that it's numeric with double percision


## Plotting a histogram
Now that the Mean.Annual.wage is usable we can begin to look at it.
```{r}
hist( utah$Mean.Annual.Wage )
```

## More plotting

### Total Occupations and Mean Annual Wage
```{r}
plot(utah$Mean.Annual.Wage, utah$TOT_EMP)
```
### Barplots
```{r}
#barplot()
```


## Slicing up the DataFrame
```{r}
utah2 <-  utah[1:25,]
```
## Reordering a DataFrame

```{r}
utah2 = utah[order(utah$Mean.Annual.Wage, decreasing=TRUE),]
utah2$Mean.Annual.Wage[1:5]
```
