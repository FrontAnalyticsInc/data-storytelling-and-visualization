## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
set.seed(1234)
dat <- data.frame(cond = factor(rep(c("A","B"), each=200)), 
                   rating = c(rnorm(200),rnorm(200, mean=.8)))

# Overlaid histograms
ggplot(dat, aes(x=rating, fill=cond)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, alpha=.5, position="identity")

# Interleaved histograms
ggplot(dat, aes(x=rating, fill=cond)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, position="dodge")

# Density plots
ggplot(dat, aes(x=rating, colour=cond)) + geom_density()

# Density plots with semi-transparent fill
ggplot(dat, aes(x=rating, fill=cond)) + geom_density(alpha=.3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
